# EverestCapitalUSA.com — Portfolio File Guide

## How It Works

The portfolio page has **10 project cards**, each with a **photo gallery** and an **embedded PDF viewer**. When you provide files for a project, I'll upload them to the repo and update the HTML. The gallery auto-carousels through photos, and PDFs render inline — zero clicks needed from visitors.

## What I Need From You (Per Project)

| Item | Format | Required? | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Project name** | Text | ✅ Yes | e.g., "Bliss Palm Bay" |
| **Address** | Text | ✅ Yes | e.g., "1234 Main St, Palm Bay, FL" |
| **Type** | Text | ✅ Yes | Renovation / New Build / Duplex / Flip / etc. |
| **Status** | Text | ✅ Yes | Completed / In Progress / Sold |

## File Naming Convention

When you're ready to upload files, name them like this:

```
Project 01/
  photo-1.jpg      (front exterior)
  photo-2.jpg      (rear/side)
  photo-3.jpg      (interior kitchen)
  photo-4.jpg      (interior bathroom)
  drawing.pdf      (site plan or floor plan)

Project 02/
  photo-1.jpg
  photo-2.png
  drawing.pdf
```

**Or just upload everything in chat** — I'll handle the naming and deployment.

## How Photos Display

- Photos render as a **full-width gallery** at the top of each card (280px height)
- **Auto-carousel** every 4 seconds, pauses on hover
- Left/right navigation arrows appear when 2+ photos exist
- Counter shows "1 / 5" in top-right corner
- Best photo dimensions: **800×600** or larger (will be cropped to fit via CSS `object-fit: cover`)

## How PDFs Display

- "View Drawings" button expands to show the **full PDF inline** (500px height)
- Visitors can scroll, zoom, and navigate pages within the embedded viewer
- No download required — renders directly on the page
- Works on desktop and mobile

## Quick Start

Upload your files in our next chat session. The simplest approach:

1. **List your 10 projects** (name, address, type, status)
2. **Upload photos** — even phone photos work, I'll optimize
3. **Upload PDFs** — architectural drawings, site plans, permits

I'll handle everything else: resizing, naming, HTML updates, and deployment.
